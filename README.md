# claude-acc

Keeps Claude Code working when you have more than one Claude subscription. A menu bar app shows the 5-hour and weekly usage of every account, and a background job moves your running Claude Code sessions to the account with the most headroom once the current one runs out. No restart, no `/login`, no terminal.

The UI text and the code comments are in Polish.

## What it does

- **Menu bar ring** with the usage of the active account, for whichever window (5 hours or weekly) runs out first. It turns orange at 75% and red at 90%. An orange dot means some account needs to log in again.
- **Panel** with every account: 5-hour and weekly bars, when each window resets ("za 2h 5min", "za 4d 4h"), which account goes next, and when the subscription renews. For the active account it also shows when, at the current pace, the watcher will switch away from it.
- **Automatic switching** when the active account is down to 5% of the session or 3% of the week. It picks the account with the most weekly headroom and keeps accounts you mark as last resort (a company seat, say) for the end.
- **One-click switch** to any account. Running sessions keep working because Claude Code reads its credentials from the Keychain on the fly.
- **Log in again** for an account whose refresh token died. The button runs `claude auth login` in the background and opens the browser with the email pre-filled. Before saving anything, it asks the API which account you actually signed into, so a browser logged into the wrong account can't overwrite anything.
- **Mac janitor** that keeps the disk free of build caches and tool junk that agents leave behind, at login and every 3 hours. The panel shows free space, the last cleanup and a button to clean up now. See [Mac janitor](#mac-janitor).

## How it works

A Claude Code account is the `claudeAiOauth` object inside a Keychain entry. Claude Code reads `Claude Code-credentials`, plus `Claude Code-credentials-<first 8 hex chars of sha256(config dir)>` when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set. [Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca) keeps a copy of every account you add to it under `Orca Claude Code Managed Credentials`. Switching accounts means copying one account's `claudeAiOauth` into the entries the live sessions read.

- `accswitch.py` holds all the logic. launchd runs `accswitch.py tick` every 2 minutes, with or without the app.
- The menu bar app (SwiftUI) is a thin UI. It runs `accswitch.py status --json` every minute and `switch` or `login` when you click.
- Usage comes from `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, and the account behind a token from `/api/oauth/profile`.

## How it avoids logging you out

Each of these rules comes from an account that actually lost its login while the tool was being built:

- Refreshing a token rotates it, and presenting a refresh token that was already used got the whole account logged out. Claude Code sessions refresh the active account on their own, about 5 minutes before the token expires, so the watcher never refreshes the active account while a session could. It copies the pair the session wrote instead, from whichever Keychain entry the sessions use (`Claude Code-credentials` without `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, the hashed one with it). It refreshes the active account itself only once the token has been expired for 15 minutes, when no session is running.
- Inactive accounts are refreshed only by the watcher and your clicks, one process at a time behind a file lock. The panel only reads.
- It never writes a token it hasn't checked against the API first. A future expiry date doesn't prove the token still works.
- It replaces only `claudeAiOauth`. The same Keychain entry holds `mcpOAuth`, the tokens of your MCP servers, which belong to the config directory and survive every switch.
- A 429 from the usage endpoint means "unknown", never "dead". It backs off for 15 minutes and doesn't refresh or flag anything in the meantime. Whether a token works is checked against the profile endpoint, so switching still works while the usage endpoint is throttled.
- Before overwriting the live entry it copies the token there back to its Orca copy, because the running session may have rotated it since the last switch.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer, with Swift 6 (Xcode or the command line tools) to build the app.
- `/usr/bin/python3` (ships with the command line tools).
- Claude Code. Tested with 2.1.282.
- Orca with your Claude accounts added as managed accounts, and **System default** selected as the active Claude account in Orca. With a managed account selected, Orca puts its own account back whenever a terminal starts and every 15 minutes, undoing every switch, and it refreshes that account's token itself. claude-acc reads Orca's settings, and while an account is selected there the watcher stands down, switching is blocked and the panel tells you to pick System default.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/outofplace-space/claude-acc.git
cd claude-acc
./install.sh
```

The installer copies the scripts to `~/.local/share/claude-acc`, adds a `claude-acc` command to `~/.local/bin`, loads the two launchd jobs (the account watcher and the janitor), then builds and opens `~/Applications/Claude Acc.app`. The app adds itself to your login items on first run. You can turn that off in the panel.

## Command line

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `claude-acc status` | Usage of every account and the switching order |
| `claude-acc who` | The active account, its burn rate and when it will hit the wall |
| `claude-acc switch <email>` | Switch to that account |
| `claude-acc switch --auto` | Switch to the next account in line |
| `claude-acc login <email>` | Log the account in again in the browser |
| `claude-acc heal [--deep]` | Recover accounts whose Orca copy died after a rotation elsewhere |
| `claude-acc tick` | One watcher pass (what launchd runs) |
| `claude-acc clean [--dry-run]` | Clean up now: every janitor task, whatever its schedule |
| `claude-acc mac status` | Free space, the last cleanup and warnings |
| `claude-acc mac report` | What slows the Mac down: top processes, Spotlight, orphaned dev servers, data of uninstalled apps, broken launchd entries |
| `claude-acc mac spotlight` | Projects whose `node_modules` Spotlight indexes, and the settings pane to exclude them |
| `claude-acc mac optimize [--dry-run\|--undo]` | Faster Dock, window and Finder animations, and disabling launch agents whose app is gone. Reversible |

## Configuration

`~/.local/share/claude-acc/config.json`. Every key is optional.

| `hard_weekly_left` | `3` | Switch when it has this % of the week left |
| `min_session_left` / `min_weekly_left` | `15` / `8` | An account needs at least this much to be switched to |
| `last_resort` | `[]` | Emails used only when nothing else has headroom |
| `never` | `[]` | Emails never switched to |
| `config_dir` | `~/.claude` | The config directory whose sessions get switched |
| `other_config_dirs` | `[]` | Other config directories whose entries get the new token when an account refreshes, but are never switched |

## Mac janitor

Agents build, install and test all day, and every run leaves something on disk: `.next` caches of a few GB per worktree, `node_modules` of projects nobody touched in a month, `go-build` temp dirs from interrupted test runs, npx and uv caches. `janitor.py` removes what a build or an install brings back, and only what nobody is using.

launchd runs `janitor.py sweep` at login and every 3 hours as a background process: macOS keeps it on the efficiency cores and throttles its disk access, so a cleanup never competes with your work. Right after boot it waits until the system has been up for 5 minutes, and on battery below 30% it waits for the charger.

Before removing anything it checks, with one `lsof` over your processes, that no process has a file open in it and that no program has its working directory there. A terminal sitting at a prompt in the project doesn't count, a dev server does. The directory is renamed first and deleted after, so a dev server starting at that moment builds from scratch instead of reading half-deleted chunks. An interrupted delete is finished on the next run.

| Task | What goes | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `next` | `.next` and `.next-*` next to a `package.json`, unchanged for 24 hours | every run |
| `caches` | `.turbo`, `node_modules/.cache`, `node_modules/.vite`, unchanged for 7 days | daily |
| `node_modules` | every `node_modules` of a project where no file changed and git didn't move for 30 days | daily |
| `tmp` | `go-build*` in `$TMPDIR` older than 6 hours | every run |
| `caps` | the oldest entries of folders listed in `caps` once a folder is over its limit | every run |
| `go` | the Go build cache, once it's over 20 GB (Go trims entries unused for 5 days on its own) | daily |
| `npm` | `npm cache verify`, npx packages unused for 30 days (not the ones a running process uses, like MCP servers), npm logs older than a week | daily |
| `pnpm` | `pnpm store prune`, and after every run that removed a `node_modules` | weekly |
| `docker` | dangling images and build cache older than a week, only when the engine is already running | daily |
| `xcode` | DerivedData unchanged for 14 days, unavailable simulators | daily |
| `brew` | `brew cleanup --prune=14` | weekly |
| `uv` | `uv cache prune` | weekly |
| `logs` | files in `~/Library/Logs` older than 30 days | daily |

Each run also checks which projects' `node_modules` end up in the Spotlight index. Spotlight skips directories whose name starts with a dot or ends with `.noindex`, so pnpm's `.pnpm` store is never indexed, but hoisted `node_modules` (Expo, npm, yarn) are, and every install makes Spotlight chew through tens of thousands of files. Neither a `.metadata_never_index` file nor `chflags hidden` stops it on current macOS. The fix is System Settings > Spotlight > Search Privacy; `claude-acc mac spotlight` lists the projects and opens that pane.

`janitor-root.sh` does what needs root, run it by hand with `sudo`: it parks system launchd entries whose app is gone in `/Library/launchd-disabled-<date>` and removes crash reports older than a month. With `--high-power` it also switches a Mac that supports it to High Power mode on the charger (battery stays on automatic). `--dry-run` shows what it would do. The iOS simulator dyld cache in `/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Caches` is protected by SIP even from root, so it stays.

Configuration lives in `~/.local/share/claude-acc/janitor.json`. Every key is optional.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roots` | `~/Documents`, `~/Developer`, `~/Projects`, `~/code`, `~/src` | Where projects live |
| `protect` | `[]` | Paths the janitor never touches (footage, experiment results) |
| `next_idle_hours` | `24` | Age of a `.next` cache before it goes |
| `cache_idle_days` | `7` | Age of `.turbo` and `node_modules/.cache` |
| `node_modules_idle_days` | `30` | Project inactivity before its `node_modules` goes, `0` turns it off |
| `npx_idle_days` | `30` | Age of an npx package |
| `go_cache_max_gb` | `20` | Go build cache size that triggers `go clean -cache` |
| `derived_data_idle_days` | `14` | Age of Xcode DerivedData |
| `log_days` | `30` | Age of logs in `~/Library/Logs` |
| `min_battery_percent` | `30` | On battery below this, the run waits for the charger |
| `notify_min_gb` | `2` | A run that frees at least this much sends a notification |
| `low_disk_gb` | `40` | Below this much free space, a warning (at most every 12 hours) |
| `skip` | `[]` | Task names to leave out, like `["docker", "brew"]` |
| `caps` | `[]` | Folders agents fill without end, like `[{"path": "~/.cache/portivo-perf/*/builds", "max_gb": 10, "keep": 1}]`. Entries over `max_gb` go oldest first (by creation date, since `rsync -a` copies mtimes); the `keep` newest always stay, and so does anything changed in the last `fresh_minutes` (10) |

## Tests

```sh
/usr/bin/python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The tests run the real script end to end against fake `security`, `curl` and `claude` binaries put first on `PATH`, so they never touch your Keychain or your accounts. They cover logging in, switching during a 429, keeping MCP tokens, cancelling a login halfway, and leaving an account whose token died.

The janitor tests run the real script on a temporary `$HOME` with the real `lsof`: caches that go, caches kept because a file is open or a dev server works in the app, a shell prompt that doesn't block, protected paths, stale and active projects, an interrupted delete, and `caps` dropping the oldest snapshots.

To see the panel without clicking the menu bar, render it to a PNG, from live data or from a JSON file:

```sh
"$HOME/Applications/Claude Acc.app/Contents/MacOS/ClaudeAcc" --render panel.png --snapshot docs/demo-snapshot.json
```

## Caveats

- It relies on undocumented endpoints and on Claude Code's own OAuth client, so any Claude Code update can break it.
- This project is not affiliated with Anthropic. Section 3.7 of Anthropic's [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) prohibits accessing the services "through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script, or otherwise" outside the API, and this tool polls those endpoints from a script. Read the terms and decide for yourself.
- The renewal date is the monthly anniversary of the subscription start. The API doesn't expose the billing date, so it's wrong for yearly plans.
